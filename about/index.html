            <h2> About </h2>
        </div>
        <p> We are a group of 7th graders at a small charter school in New Jersey working to help the environment and climate in the current day crisis.
            We've created a short film to inform the public of our current situation, and are still continuing to try to help our current situation.
            We think that with enough people behind the cause, we can change the world.
